	In this study, a quadcopter stand with three degrees of freedom was controlled using game theory-based control. The first player tracks a desired input, and the second player creates a disturbance in the tracking of the first player to cause an error in the tracking. The move is chosen using the Nash equilibrium, which presupposes that the other player made the worst move.. In addition to being resistant to input interruptions, this method may also be resilient to modeling system uncertainty. This method evaluated the performance through simulation in the Simulink environment and implementation on a three-degree-of-freedom stand.
