## Converting REMARKâ€™s single-objective optimization algorithm to multi-objective
### Introduction
REMARK is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is used to solve single-objective optimization problems. In this project, we will convert REMARK to multi-objective optimization algorithm. The main idea is to use the concept of Pareto dominance to compare two solutions. The algorithm will be tested on the ZDT1 problem.
## Results 
The results of the algorithm are shown in the following figures. The first figure shows the Pareto set and the Pareto front. The second figure shows the Pareto set and the Pareto front in 3D. The third figure shows the animation of the Pareto set and the Pareto front. The fourth figure shows the animation of the Pareto set and the Pareto front in 3D.
